About me: 
I am a results-driven Full-Stack Software Developer and QA Engineer with a strong foundation in both coding and quality assurance. Holding an M.A. in English Literature from Brooklyn College and with over six years of teaching experience, I bring a unique perspective to problem-solving and collaboration. I am a graduate of both ZipCode Wilmington and Tech Elevator, where I honed my skills in software development and quality assurance.

Leveraging my deep technical expertise, I work to integrate best practices in both software development and QA to enhance testing processes, identify bugs early, and create efficient, scalable applications. I have designed comprehensive test cases, troubleshot complex issues, and ensured the delivery of high-quality applications that meet both functional and non-functional requirements. My passion lies in bridging the gap between development and quality to deliver seamless, user-centered solutions.
