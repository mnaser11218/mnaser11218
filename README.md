## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
My Name is Mohammed Naser. 

Welcome to my GitHub. 


## About me: 
I am a Full-Stack Software Developer and QA Engineer with a strong foundation in both coding and quality assurance. Holding an M.A. in English Literature from Brooklyn College and with over six years of high school teaching experience, I bring a unique perspective to problem-solving and team-work collaboration. I completed my training at two renowned Java Full-Stack Bootcamps in Wilmington, Delaware: ZipCode Wilmington and Tech Elevator. My passion lies in bridging the gap between software development and quality assurance to deliver seamless, user-centered solutions. I enjoy exploring creative ideas and transforming them into real-life projects. Feel free to check out some of my work below!
