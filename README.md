## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
My Name is Mohammed Naser. 

Welcome to my GitHub. 


## About me: 
I am a Results-driven, Full-Stack Software Developer and QA Engineer with a strong foundation in both coding and quality assurance. Holding an M.A. in English Literature from Brooklyn College and with over six years of teaching experience, I bring a unique perspective to problem-solving and collaboration. I graduated from both ZipCode Wilmington and Tech Elevator (two renowned Java full-stack Bootcamps in Wilmington, Delaware), where I honed my skills in software development and quality assurance. My passion lies in bridging the gap between development and quality assurance to deliver seamless, user-centered solutions!
